# About

Alice is a tool for verifying proofs in constructive logic, specifically designed to assist students in the study of constructive logic.

[Constructive logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic), also known as intuitionistic logic, is a form of logic that emphasizes the constructive nature of proofs.
Alice provides an interactive user interface in the notion of [natural deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction), where students can learn by doing ‚Äî constructing proofs step by step, with immediate feedback and support.

In addition to the graphical user interface, Alice includes its own mini programming language that emphasizes the beauty of the [Curry-Howard Isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence).
This isomorphism links logic and computation and is the foundation of modern proof assistants like [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) and [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).
It can be experienced within Alice by seamlessly switching between the graphical user interface and a code editor while constructing proofs, helping to bridge the gap between theory and practical application in proof assistants.

Alice is served as a standalone web app, using Rust and WebAssembly for its backend and React for the frontend.

# Build Instructions

## Prerequisites

To build Alice, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. **Rust**: Install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. **wasm-pack**: Install wasm-pack from [rustwasm.github.io](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/).
3. **NodeJs** and **NPM**: Install NodeJs and NPM from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Build the WebAssembly Binary of the Backend

In the root directory of the project, run the following command to build the WebAssembly binary:

`wasm-pack build`

## Step 2: Build the Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` directory. Make sure the required dependices are installed by running `npm install`. Then run

`npm run build`

This will bundle the frontend assets and the WebAssembly binary and the final files will be output to the `dist` folder in the project root directory. These can be served by any HTTP server.

# Tests

Alice has a series of autmatic tests. To run them, make sure you are in the project root and run:

`cargo test`
